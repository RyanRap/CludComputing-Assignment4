the most challenging part was the dynamo db stuff which I could not get to work, even after trying to use chatgpt and google.

I was not able to get mongodb fully functional, it does connect to it but does not update it. 
I got the kubernete demo to work  but I was unable to get the actual yaml files to be used I kept getting errors that the internet was no help in solving.
Parameter store is still not being used as I ran out of time to work on it.
